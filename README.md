## Database Architecture

![The database has five tables: Bootcamps, Students, Assignments, Comments, and Users. Students and Users stores the primary key of Bootcamps item that the person is linked to. Assignments and Comments hold the primary key of the student that the item is associated with.](./finalDataArchitecture.drawio.svg)

## Routes

Successful responses come through in the following object:

```
{
  success: true,
  message: 'Descriptive message',
  payload: // If request affected a single item, an     object. If request affected multiple items, an array of objects.
}
```

Unsucessful responses return the following object:

```
{
  success: false,
  message: 'Descriptive message'
}
```
